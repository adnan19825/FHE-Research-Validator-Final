# v6.3 Enterprise Architecture Specification
**Target Release:** Q2 2027
**Status:** In Design

## 1. System Overview
The v6.3 release introduces a hybrid runtime environment designed to ensure 100% ecosystem coverage for FHE workloads. It moves beyond "WebGPU only" to a tiered architecture.

## 2. Tiered Runtime Strategy

### Tier 1: WebGPU Acceleration (Primary)
- **Target:** Flagship Mobiles (iPhone 17 Pro, S25 Ultra), Desktop GPUs.
- **Technology:** WGSL Compute Shaders.
- **Performance:** < 5ms (NTT 4096).
- **Status:** ✅ Validated in v1.0.

### Tier 2: WASM SIMD Core (Compatibility)
- **Target:** Business Laptops, Firefox ESR, Corporate Environments.
- **Technology:** Rust Core -> WASM (with SIMD128 intrinsics).
- **Performance Target:** < 20ms.
- **Security:** Constant-Time Montgomery Multiplication.

### Tier 3: Server Proxy (Fallback)
- **Target:** Legacy/Restricted Environments.
- **Technology:** Node.js Relay.
- **Status:** Fallback only.

## 3. Security Specification (Timing Attacks)
All implementations (WGSL & WASM) must adhere to constant-time execution principles.
- **Requirement:** No data-dependent branching in Modular Arithmetic.
- **Verification:** Statistical variance testing on execution timing.

## 4. Implementation Plan
1. [ ] Port `ntt_simd` kernel to Rust.
2. [ ] Implement `runtime-loader.js` for dynamic backend switching.
3. [ ] Add CI/CD pipelines for WASM builds.
